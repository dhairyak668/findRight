Hello everyone

About:
This is my personal project FindRight. It is a mobile application that serves as a multisided platform. FindRight aims to connect its users with skilled professionals who can get the job done and, at the same time, provide a bigger market for freelancers and blue-collar workers to progress in.
This application comprises two kinds of users: a normal user and a service provider. A normal user can make requests from their end eg: plumbing, gardening, etc.
A Service Provider skilled in that particular task can view and accept those requests. (A similar comparable model is Uber but for blue-collar workers.) 
This helps users meet their service needs and expands the market for skilled professionals.
